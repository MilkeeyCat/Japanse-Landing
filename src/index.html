                    <p class="content__dish-description">Sushi is prepared from white fine-grained Japanese rice mixed with a specially made sauce made from rice vinegar, sugar, salt - such rice is called sumeshi (Japanese 酢 酢, literally "vinegar rice"). Some fusion cuisine restaurants use short grain brown rice and wild rice. Rice is cooked in Japanese style (with preliminary rinsing, in a closed container with a minimum amount of water, without salt, water is pre-infused on kombu sheets), and before preparing sushi, it is allowed to cool in a special wooden tub - hangiri (or cooled, for example, fanning rice fan). Sushi rice should usually be used as soon as it hasreached room temperature.</p>
